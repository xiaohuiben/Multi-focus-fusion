# Multi-focus-fusion
This is the code for paper "Multi-focus image fusion based on sparse feature matrix decomposition and morphological filtering, Optics Communications,2015"



The proposed method is based on low-rank and sparse matrix decompostion, and morphological filtering. 

Please run the file of "demo.m" for comparison of our method in Matlab, if you are interested in our work.
